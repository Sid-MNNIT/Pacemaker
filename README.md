ü©∫ Problem Statement: AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot for Disease Awareness
Title

‚ÄúArogyƒÅ Bandhu‚Äù ‚Äì AI Chatbot for Disease Awareness in Odisha

Background / Context:

In Odisha, many communities‚Äîespecially in remote, tribal, rural, and under-served areas‚Äîface challenges in accessing timely, accurate health information. Misunderstandings, myths, delayed diagnosis, language barriers, and low health literacy exacerbate disease burdens. The Government of Odisha has made telemedicine helplines, health centres and outreach programs, but there is still a gap in continuous, accessible, reliable awareness and preventive advisory services.

Digital penetration (mobile phones etc.) is rising, but many people hesitate to approach formal services for questions that seem ‚Äúsmall‚Äù until they become serious.

Problem:

People lack a trusted, easy-to-use channel to ask health questions and get reliable answers in local languages.

Many disease outbreaks go un-recognized or poorly understood early on (e.g. dengue, malaria, seasonal flu, gastrointestinal infections).

Public health messaging is often generic, not interactive, and fails to adapt to individual concerns, symptoms, or local context.

Because of limited resources, human health workers can‚Äôt respond in real time to every query.

Scope / Constraints:

Geography / Demographics: Odisha, with focus also on remote and tribal areas; languages include Odia, tribal dialects.

Channels & Access: Should work on low-bandwidth / low-data mobile devices; possibly via WhatsApp / SMS / app / web.

Data / Privacy: Follow govt. regulations, ensure privacy of personal health queries; anonymize data.

Accuracy / Trust: Answers must align with official health guidelines, validated by medical experts.

Scalability & Offline Access: May have intermittent connectivity; must handle many parallel queries.

Objectives:

Build a chatbot (‚ÄúArogyƒÅ Bandhu‚Äù) that allows users to ask disease-related questions (symptoms, prevention, when to see doctor).

Provide trustworthy, localized, context-aware responses in Odia (and other relevant local languages).

Increase awareness of prevention measures for major regional diseases (e.g. malaria, diarrhoea, vector borne, seasonal).

Include features to escalate: if symptoms severe, guide them to nearest facility / helpline.

Analytics dashboard for government to see frequent concerns, patterns, outbreaks.

Importance / Impact:

Empower citizens with knowledge ‚Üí early prevention, reduced disease severity, reduced burden on health system.

Help prevent misinformation / rumors about diseases, treatments, etc.

Improve health outcomes‚Äîespecially in vulnerable populations.

Aid government in planning, resource allocation, and targeted awareness campaigns.

Success Criteria (KPIs):

% of responding accurately to ‚â• X% of user queries (as validated by health experts).

Response time: average < Y seconds.

Number of users engaged; drop in health hotline calls for basic queries.

User satisfaction (feedback).

Reduction in certain preventable disease incidence (longer term).
